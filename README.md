Logistic Regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

A classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

# Dataset
The first and second column of `'data1.txt'` are the Scores of the two exams. And the third column is the result whether the student
gets admitted into a university.

This exercise is from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This Assignment is originally written in MATLAB, but in this repository I converted it to Python.
